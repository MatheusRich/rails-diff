# Rails Diff

Compare your Rails application files with the ones generated by Rails main
branch. This helps you keep track of changes between your customized files and
the latest Rails templates.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-diff'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install rails-diff
```

## Usage

### Command Line

Inside your Rails application directory, run:

```bash
$ rails-diff diff FILE [FILE ...]
```

For example, to compare your Dockerfile with the one from Rails:

```bash
$ rails-diff diff Dockerfile
```

You can also compare multiple files at once:

```bash
$ rails-diff diff Dockerfile .gitignore config/application.rb
```

Common files to compare:

- `Dockerfile`
- `.gitignore`
- `Gemfile`
- `config/application.rb`

### Ruby API

You can also use Rails::Diff programmatically in your Ruby code:

```ruby
require 'rails/diff'

diff = Rails::Diff.for('Dockerfile')
puts diff
```

## How it works

When you run the diff, it will:

1. Clone the latest Rails from main branch
1. Generate a new Rails app with the same name as yours
1. Show you a colored diff between your file and the generated one
